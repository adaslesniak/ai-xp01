# ai-xp01 - artificial intelligence, experiment 01
The goals:
1 - get hands dirty with NN and learn how to work with it

I will use algoriticmally solvable problem for following reasons:
a) it's easy to generate data
b) it will allow me to have a look if there are any patterns in NN shape that can be somehow mapped to algorithm
c) it will allow me to check (in orders of magnitude) efficiency of NN against algorithms
d) it will allow me to do easy performance tests since I have ultimate reference point

C) It's interesting problem how humans can do math, but all they have are their brain which is kind of NN. While really most humans just suck at solving math equations as compared to computer there is known fenomenon if "idiod-savant" so it's clear that human brains are not trained and optimized for this. While this example won't prove anything it may be interesting in this area. Additionally if there was a way to integrate math equations in terems of NN architecture that could be interesting.

# artificial problem
AI as narrowed to Deep Learning can be understood as artificial intuition. So can we intuitively feel matrices. If this example fails, it will be point against doing lot of matrix calculations as my brain won't be able to grasp it intuitively anyway, so I'll always have to use computers. There is just no point in doing that manually. However if results are good, then... then it may get intersting.

So I'll generate set of matrices with their determinants. Goal is to train NN to solve to intuitively feel if given matrix has determinant equal to zero.
